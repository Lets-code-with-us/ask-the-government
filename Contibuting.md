## 🧑‍💻 First-Time Contributors

We’re beginner-friendly!

* `good first issue`
* `help wanted`
* `backend`
* `frontend`
* `documentation`

Once you find something you'd like to work on:

1. **Comment on the issue** so others know you're working on it
2. **Wait for assignment or confirmation**
3. Start coding!

## 📌 Our Git Workflow


1. Sync your fork’s `main` with upstream
2. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/issue-123-voting-api
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run the app locally and test it
5. Push your branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/issue-123-voting-api
   ```
6. Create a pull request from your feature branch → `main` on the **original repo**
7. Add a clear title and description to your PR

> 🛑 Avoid making PRs directly from your `main` branch!

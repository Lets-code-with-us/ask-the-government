# Ask the Government

Citizens can upvote or downvote questions using a simple **Yes/No** voting system, helping surface the most relevant public concerns.

> ✅ The frontend is built and live.  
> 🚧 The backend, database integration, and vote persistence logic are in progress — contributions welcome!
